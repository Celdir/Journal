Today was a Tuesday.
I realize that the significance of that is not readily apparent, so I'll explain.
Tuesday is one of my busiest days. In addition to all of my normal school work, I have voice lessons at Hill College after school.
To complement the busyness, I've had absolutely terrible allergies today. At the time of writing this, my veins have more snot than blood running through them.
However, aside from the allergies and overwhelming amounts of work (this is normal), it was a pretty good day.
Well, actually, pretty average. I suppose if my average day is 'pretty good', my life is going pretty well. That's a nice thought.
Anthony wasn't at school today. Evidently, he was quite sick. He almost threw up when he turned the lights in his room on. How unfortunate.
On days that Anthony is gone, I really don't have anyone to talk to for the majority of the day. I don't really relate to the rest of my class very well.
Anyway, I need to do a bit of tweaking to the program. Namely, adding the entry viewing functionality. So, I suppose I should go now.
Signing off for the night,
WhiteWizard
