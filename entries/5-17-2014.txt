Well, today I made the command line part of the program quite a bit better by allowing actual expressions after the command. xD
In other news, today we sent the money and forms off to Harvard for the summer school programs. Woo!
Also, I'm about to go see ET with Allen, so I better go take a quick shower and get ready.
Signing off,
